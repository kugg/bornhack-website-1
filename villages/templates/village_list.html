<p>
  If this is your first hackercamp the term 'Village' might be confusing but it
  is fairly simple: a village is just a spot on the campsite where you and a
  bunch of your friends/likeminded people camp together. Apart from peoples
  individual tents which they sleep in, many villages bring a large common tent
  where you can hack and hang out during the day.

    It is also possible to rent a tent, chairs and tables for villages here.
